* Crazy Idea:
** HTTP server in Common Lisp
** Part of an application (does only what it needs)
** Full blown not-invented-here syndrome
** 'ship in a bottle' project

* Problems:
** how to deploy to Heroku?!
** how to stop this insanity!

* TODO:
** write testing library
** wrap socket calls (for stubbing ease)
** parse request into parts
** 404 errors
** error handling (to allow for 500s)
** routing
